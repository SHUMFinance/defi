Buildr is part of Shumâ€™s decentralised application suite. Users can stake Shum tokens to build sUSD, the base currency of Shum Exchange. Stakers are entitled to  and a split of the transaction fees generated by Shum Exchange. Users can then use sUSD minted to purchase synthetic assets on Shum Exchange to gain different investment exposures. sUSD can also be moved to other protocols or dApps within the DeFi ecosystem. As such, Buildr will involve three separate functions in this case, Build, Burn, and Claim
